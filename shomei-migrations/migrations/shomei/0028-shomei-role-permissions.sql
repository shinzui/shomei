-- Role→permission definitions (EP-9): a role implies a set of flat verb-noun capability
-- strings (e.g. 'projects:write'), resolved to the union across a subject's roles at token
-- mint and carried in the 'permissions' claim. The FK into shomei_roles makes "a permission
-- can only attach to a defined role" a database invariant (typo protection), mirroring the
-- shomei_role_grants.role FK. There is deliberately no CASCADE on the role FK — the registry
-- is append-only, so a role is never deleted.

-- Time-bound grants (EP-9): a nullable expiry on each grant. NULL means "forever", so every

-- filters (expires_at IS NULL OR expires_at > $now); nothing fires at the instant a grant
-- expires, and the (already-inert) row is swept later as hygiene.
